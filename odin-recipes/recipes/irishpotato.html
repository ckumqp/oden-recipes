    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Potato farls are a traditional Irish potato bread that forms an essential part of the famous Ulster Fry breakfast. These delicious triangular breads are made from a simple mixture of mashed potatoes and flour, then fried until golden and crispy on the outside while remaining soft and fluffy on the inside.</p>
        <p>Dating back generations, potato farls (from the Gaelic word "fardel" meaning "fourth part") were created as a way to use leftover mashed potatoes. They're incredibly versatile - serve them hot with breakfast alongside eggs and bacon, or with butter and jam for a simple snack. They're particularly popular on St. Patrick's Day, but delicious enough to enjoy year-round!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) starchy potatoes (such as Russet or Maris Piper), peeled and cut into chunks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil or butter for frying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes thoroughly and return them to the hot pot. Allow them to steam dry for 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the butter, salt, and pepper to the potatoes and mash until smooth and lump-free.</li>
        <li>Allow the mashed potatoes to cool slightly until they're comfortable to handle but still warm.</li>
        <li>Add the flour to the mashed potatoes and mix gently until a soft dough forms. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the farls tough.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead lightly just until smooth.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 2 equal portions and shape each into a ball.</li>
        <li>Roll or pat each ball into a circle about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick.</li>
        <li>Using a knife, cut each circle into 4 triangular wedges (farls).</li>
        <li>Heat the oil or butter in a large skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the farls for 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crispy on the outside.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately while hot, or cool on a wire rack if saving for later.</li>
    </ol>

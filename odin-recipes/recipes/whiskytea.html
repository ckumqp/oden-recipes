    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whisky Tea is a warming, soothing beverage that combines the robust flavors of black tea with the complex notes of good whisky. This comforting drink has been enjoyed in Scotland and Ireland for generations, especially on cold, damp evenings or as a nightcap before bed.</p>
        <p>The beauty of Whisky Tea lies in its simplicity. The whisky's natural warmth and complexity perfectly complement the tannins in black tea, while honey or sugar adds just enough sweetness to round out the flavors. A touch of lemon brightens the drink, making it both refreshing and comforting at the same time.</p>

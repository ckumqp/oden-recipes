    <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become beloved worldwide for its rich flavors and comforting layers. This traditional recipe features sheets of pasta layered with a savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel, and generous amounts of cheese, all baked to perfection until bubbly and golden.</p>
         <p>Originating from the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy, authentic lasagna has evolved over generations. This version balances the richness of the meat ragù with the velvety smoothness of béchamel sauce, rather than using ricotta cheese as seen in many American adaptations. The result is a hearty, satisfying dish perfect for family gatherings, special occasions, or whenever you crave a taste of Italian comfort food.</p>

                <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>

                <li>Salt and white pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 package (16 oz) lasagna noodles (or fresh pasta sheets)</li>
                <li>2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
                <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrots, and celery, cooking until softened (about 5-7 minutes). Add garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant. Add ground beef and pork, breaking up with a wooden spoon and cooking until browned. Pour in the red wine and simmer until reduced by half. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, bay leaves, oregano, and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook uncovered for 1.5-2 hours, stirring occasionally, until thickened and flavors have melded. Remove bay leaves.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Make the Béchamel Sauce:</strong> In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat. Add flour and whisk continuously for 2 minutes to make a roux. Gradually whisk in the warm milk, making sure no lumps form. Continue to cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon (about 5-7 minutes). Remove from heat and season with nutmeg, salt, and white pepper.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Cook the Pasta:</strong> If using dried lasagna noodles, cook according to package directions until al dente. Drain and lay flat on clean kitchen towels to prevent sticking. If using fresh pasta sheets, no pre-cooking is necessary.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Set your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        
        <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna:</strong> Spread a thin layer of béchamel sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add a layer of lasagna noodles, slightly overlapping. Spread a layer of meat sauce over the pasta, then drizzle with béchamel and sprinkle with some of both cheeses. Repeat the layers (pasta, meat sauce, béchamel, cheeses) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of béchamel and a generous topping of both cheeses.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake for another 15-20 minutes until the top is golden brown and bubbly.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Allow the lasagna to rest for 15-20 minutes before cutting. This helps the layers set and makes for cleaner slices.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired, and serve with a simple green salad and crusty bread.</li>
